# CSE-208-BUET
# Description

This repository contains all the codes of **Data Structure and Algorithms II Sessional**. Basically, there are implementations of different algorithms
and data structures in java as required in the offlines and onlines.

| apsp | All Pair Shortest Path Algorithm | Floyd-Warshall's ALgorithm, Matrix Multiplication Strategy |
| branch-and-bound | Branch and Bound Algorithm | Apllication in *Band Matrix Multiplication* |
| fib-heap | Fibonacci Heap | Implementations of Binomial Heap, Fibonacci Heap |
| graph | Graph | Matrix Implementation (although not included in this folder, *List Implementation* is used in other DS/Algo) |
| hash-table | Hash Table | Separate Chaining Mode, Open Addressing Mode (Comment one to use the other) |

| sssp | Single Source Shortest Path | Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford's Algorithm |

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository
* Install [Intelij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) or browse to an online IDE for java , e.g. [onlinegdb java](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler)
* Copy-paste the .java files
* Run the file containing **public static void main(String args[])** method
* **_Note: If there is read/write from/to text file(s), then those files must be put outside the src folder in Intellij IDEA_**

### Prerequisites

* [Java jdk](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) - lts version(long term stable) , e.g. v8, v11, v17
* [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) Community Edition (free)

### Installing

* [How to Install Intellij IDEA on Windows 10 + Creating First Hello World Java Application](https://youtu.be/EMLTOMdIz4w)

## Running the tests

Test cases are given in the specifications in the same folder as the .java files

## Reference Materials 

* **Introduction to Algorithms**, 3rd Edition, _Thomas H. Cormen_, _Charles E. Leiserson_, _Ronald L. Rivest_, and _Clifford Stein_
